# Yuzu
A discord bot made in Go using discordgo

Yuzu has been in develpment for a while now, recently decided to make it open source.\
You can use whatever you want from this project just be nice enough to mention me :)\
Invite link: [yuzu](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=368525054524260353&scope=bot&permissions=66186303)\
Support server: [discord.gg/p895czC](https://discord.gg/p895czC)\
website will come somewhere soon-ish

Just know that it is open source but if you wish to "selfhost" the bot I do **not** help you with setting things up\
Neither will I provide any support for this in any way.
